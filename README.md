# OpenEBench Widgets

**oeb-widgets** is a collection of easy-to-use Vue components for benchmarking, initially designed for OpenEBench but also usable in other projects, making it a flexible tool. It includes two essential visualizers: a **Bar Plot** and a **Scatter Plot**, both capable of handling metrics and classifications. This package has been crafted with scalability in mind, allowing for seamless addition of more visualizers in future updates.

## Features

* Bar Plot: Create bar charts to compare different categories.
* Scatter Plot: Generate scatter plots to visualize relationships between variables.
* Extensible Design: Built to support additional visualizers in future versions.

## Installation

To install the package run:

```
npm i @inb/oeb_visualizations
```

## How to Use

#### Import

```
import LoaderWidgets from '@inb/oeb-widgets/components/LoaderWidgets.vue';
```

#### Usage

```
<LoaderWidgets :data-chart="data"></LoaderWidgets>
```

Firstly, import the **LoaderWidgets** component, which receives and processes data and displays either a bar plot or a scatter plot based on the provided data.

## Bar Plot

Bar plot shows the results of a benchmarking challenge that uses one single evaluation metric in the form of a Barplot. Challenge participants are shown in the X axis, while the value of their metric is shown in the Y axis.

#### Classification

The results of this plot format can be transformed into a tabular format by sorting the participants in descending/ascending order according to their metrics and applying a quartile classification over that linear set of values. This classification splits the participants into four different groups/clusters depending on their performance. Clusters are separated in the plot with vertical lines and shown in the right table together with a green color-scale, which is easier to interpret for both experts and non-expert users.

    ],
    "visualization": {

      "type": "bar-plot"
    }
  }
}

```

## Scatter Plot

Scatter plot muestra los resultados de experimentos científicos de evaluación comparativa en formato de gráfico, y aplicar varios métodos de clasificación para transformarlos a formato tabular.

#### Classification methods

* Square quartiles - divide the plotting area in four squares by getting the 2nd quartile of the X and Y metrics.

* Diagonal quartiles - divide the plotting area with diagonal lines by assigning a score to each participant based in the distance to the 'optimal performance'.

* Clustering - group the participants using the K-means clustering algorithm and sort the clusters according to the performance.

    }
  }
}

```

## Box Plot

Box plot shiw the results of a benchmarking challenge that uses a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset on a seven-number summary of datapoints. The challenge metrics is represented in Y axis by default.

#### Classification

The result of the plot can be ordened by maximum or minimum median value.

#### Example Data Structure in Box Plot

  "_id": "OEBD003000002S",
  "dates": {
    "modification": "2024-04-05T14:00:00Z"
